# YANGstraight_source
Faster than real-time and audio sampling rate extraction of fo and event candidates
using an analytic signal with a cosine series envelope

## Introduction

GUI tools are for users to acquire intuitive understanding of wavelet phase and derived attributes. This is a second step to reformulate STRAIGHT, a speech analysis, modification and re-synthesis. Yes, I think there still are enough room for VOCODERs to explore.

## Core functions

The GUI tools and test scripts uses the following core functions. The technical reference in doc direcgtory provides details of the first three core functions.

1. designAnalyticWavelet.m
2. waveletAttributesAnalyzer.m
3. sourceAttributesAnalysis.m
4. staticTrigBsplinePowerSpec.m

### The following functions are obsolate. These will be removed in the coming release

1. designCos6Wavelet.m
2. waveletSourceAnalyzer.m
3. sourceInformationAnalysis.m

## GUI tools

The GUI directory consists of interactive tools (including realtime tools) for testing core functions. They are:

1. waveletSourceAnalyzer
2. realtimeFoViewerR
3. detailInspector

Entering these names invoke applications.

### compiled clickable application

Installer of realtimeFoViewer GUI application, and waveletVisualizer GUI application, and  offline interactive GUI inspector are linked below. WARNING: The installer starts downloading MATLAB runtime package. The size is about 900 MB. It also makes a clickable application and installes it in the designaged folder.

## Test scripts

The test directory consists of MATLAB scripts to test core functions. New collection of test scripts are added.

## Demo movies and documents

The doc directory consists of demonstration movies including short introduction and documents. The reference manual is elaborated.

## Requirement

MATLAB with signalprocessing toolbox. The GUI tools were tested on a MacBook Pro and a Windows 10 machine. Set paths to src, GUI and test directories. The files were scanned using VirusBarrier (Mac) and Norton Security Derux (Windows).
